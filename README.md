# Grimoire of Gaia Spell Integration for Iron's Spellbooks

This mod expands **Iron's Spellbooks** with spells inspired by **Grimoire of Gaia**, allowing you to **summon monster girls** from GoG to fight by your side.

Unlike their non-summon versions, these summoned versions slightly **adjusted AI and attack patterns** for better combat performance and synergy with Iron's Spellbooks’ mechanics.

## ✨ Notes

*   Highly Configurable in **config/GoGSpellsConfig.toml**.
*   Their Summon Scrolls are craftable, just check them in JEI.
*   You can also craft a necklace **The Blessing of Gaia** which adds bonus drop rate of certain loots when killing certain mobs, with which you will be able to craft those scrolls earlier.
